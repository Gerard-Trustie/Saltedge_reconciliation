Technical PRD for Reconciling Transaction Data Between JSON and CSV Files

Project Title:

Transaction Data Reconciliation Tool

Purpose:

Develop a Python-based tool to reconcile transaction data between two files:
	1.	A JSON file containing detailed transaction records.
	2.	A CSV file containing summarized or alternate transaction details.

The tool will identify matching, mismatching, and missing transactions between the two data sources to ensure accuracy and completeness of financial records.

Scope:
	•	Input Files:
	•	JSON: Detailed transaction records with fields like id, amount, description, date, and extra attributes.
	•	CSV: Tabular data with similar fields, potentially using alternate formats or naming conventions.
	•	Output:
	•	A reconciliation report highlighting:
	•	Transactions present in both files (matched).
	•	Transactions present in one file but not the other (missing).
	•	Transactions with mismatched attributes (e.g., amount discrepancies).

Functional Requirements:
	1.	File Loading:
	•	Load JSON and CSV files using Python libraries (json, pandas).
	•	Handle different encodings and file sizes efficiently.
	2.	Data Parsing and Cleaning:
	•	Normalize field names across JSON and CSV for alignment.
	•	Strip whitespace, convert dates to a standard format (e.g., ISO 8601), and ensure amounts are numeric.
	3.	Matching Logic:
	•	Match transactions using a unique identifier (id) or a combination of fields (e.g., date, amount, description).
	•	Flag transactions as:
	•	Matched: Transactions with identical attributes.
	•	Missing: Transactions present in one file but absent in the other.
	•	Mismatched: Transactions with the same id but differing attributes (e.g., amount).
	4.	Reporting:
	•	Generate a structured reconciliation report:
	•	Summary of matched, missing, and mismatched transactions.
	•	Detailed logs for mismatches, including the specific fields and discrepancies.
	•	Output the report in multiple formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
	5.	Error Handling:
	•	Gracefully handle missing or malformed files.
	•	Log errors with descriptive messages for debugging.
	6.	Scalability:
	•	Process files with thousands of transactions efficiently.
	•	Minimize memory usage by leveraging generators or chunk processing.

Technical Requirements:
	•	Language: Python 3.8+
	•	Libraries:
	•	pandas for data manipulation.
	•	json for JSON parsing.
	•	csv or pandas for CSV handling.
	•	argparse for CLI options (optional).
	•	logging for error and process logging.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Setup:
	•	Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
	•	Define project structure:

│   ├── utils.py

│   ├── test_reconcile.py

│   ├── transactions.json

	2.	Data Loading and Normalization:
	•	Parse JSON and CSV data.
	•	Normalize fields and clean data.
	3.	Reconciliation Logic:
	•	Implement matching logic with configurable thresholds (e.g., fuzzy matching for descriptions).
	4.	Output Generation:
	•	Create a structured report with summary statistics and detailed discrepancies.
	5.	Testing:
	•	Develop unit tests for each module.
	•	Test with edge cases (e.g., missing fields, corrupted files).
